Description: The primary goal of phase I clinical trials is to find the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD). To reach this objective, we introduce a new design for 
phase I clinical trials, the predictive Bayes factor (PBF) design. The PBF design 
is an innovative model-assisted design that is easy to implement in a manner 
similar to the traditional 3+3 design, as its decision rules can be pre-tabulated 
prior to the onset of trial, but is of more flexibility of selecting diverse 
target toxicity rates and cohort sizes. Moreover, it has satisfactory performance 
of selecting the true MTD to other more complicated model-based designs. Compared 
to the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design, the PBF design illustrates better 
performance with respect to competitive average probabilities of choosing 
the MTD and lower risk treating patients at overly toxic doses.
