\arguments{
\item{target}{the target DLT rate}

\item{n.cohort}{the total number of cohorts}

\item{cohortsize}{the cohort size}

\item{cutoff}{the cutoff for the predictive Bayes Factor (PrBF). Users can specify either a value or a function
for cutoff. If PrBF < cutoff, we assign the next cohort of patients to an adjacent dose based on observed DLT.
Otherwise, the evidence is in favor of \eqn{H_{0j}} and we need to retain the current dose.}

\item{K}{number of dose levels. It is required when argument cutoff is a function that requires K.}

\item{cutoff_e}{the cutoff for the dose exclusion rule. If \eqn{PrBF_{0,1}<E(n_j)}, the evidence is in favor of \eqn{H_{1j}}. If \eqn{\hat{\pi}_j < \phi},
the current dose is deemed as subtherapeutic and we exclude the current dose and lower doses; If \eqn{\hat{\pi}_j > \phi}, the current dose

\details{
We assume that there are \eqn{J} pre-specified dose levels of the drug of interest. Let \eqn{d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_J} denote
         these dose levels. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is assessed as a binary outcome, experiencing
         toxicity or not. The true dose toxicity is monotonically increasing as the dose level increases.
         Let \eqn{\phi} be the target toxicity rate and \eqn{\pi_j} be the true dose-toxicity of dose level \eqn{d_j}, for \eqn{j=1,2,\ldots,J}.

         We formulate our hypothesis as:
                                \deqn{H_{0j}: \pi_j=\phi}
                                \deqn{H_{1j}: \pi_j\ne\phi}

         \eqn{H_{0j}} indicates that \eqn{d_j} is the desired MTD so that we should stay; \eqn{H_{1j}} reflects the current dose is
         either below or above the MTD so that we should transit to a lower or upper dose level. Whether
         escalate or de-escalate the dose is straightforward: if the observed toxicity rate is above the target
         toxicity rate \eqn{\phi}, we de-escalate the dose; if the observed toxicity rate is below \eqn{\phi}, we escalate the dose.

         With the hypothesis, the predictive Bayes factor comparing \eqn{H_{0j}} and \eqn{H_{1j}} is given by
                               \deqn{PrBF_{0,1}=\frac{\phi^{y_i}(1-\phi)^{n_j-y_j}B(y_j+1,n_j-y_j+1)^{n_j}exp(1)}{B(y_j+2,n_j-y_j+1)^{y_j}B(y_j+1,n_j-y_j+2)^{n_j-y_j}}}
         where \eqn{x_j} is the toxicity response of the ith subject among \eqn{n_j} subjects that received dose \eqn{d_j}, for \eqn{j=1,2,\ldots,J}.
         \eqn{y_j} denotes the sum of toxicity response. We assume that
                               \deqn{y_j \sim Bin(n_j,\pi_j)}

         According to the calibration of the PrBF, a decision rule based on \eqn{PrBF_{0,1}} is:
         1. If \eqn{PrBF_{0,1}>C(n_j)}, the evidence is in favor of \eqn{H_{0j}} and we need to retain the current dose;
         2. Otherwise, we assign the next cohort of patients to an adjacent dose according to the observed
         DLT \eqn{\hat{\pi}_j = y_j/n_j}, such as:

         (a) If \eqn{\hat{\pi}_j < \phi}, we escalate the dose;

         (b) If \eqn{\hat{\pi}_j > \phi}, we de-escalate the dose.

         For patient safety and trial efficiency, the PoP design employs a dose exclusion rule. On
         the one hand, if the PrBF based on the observed DLT indicates a dose is above the MTD with a
         certain evidence, we exclude the current dose and doses above to avoid treating patients at an overly
         toxic dose; on the other hand, if the PrBF implies that a dose is substantially below the MTD, we
         eliminate the current dose and doses below to prevent wasting patients at a subtherapeutic dose.
         Such a dose exclusion rule is as follow:

         If \eqn{PrBF_{0,1}<E(n_j)}, the evidence is in favor of \eqn{H_{1j}} and:

         1. If \eqn{\hat{\pi}_j < \phi}, the current dose is deemed as subtherapeutic and we exclude the current dose and lower doses;

         2. If \eqn{\hat{\pi}_j > \phi}, the current dose is overly toxic and we exclude the current dose and higher doses.

         Once all the doses are eliminated from further investigation, the trial is terminated early.
         The selection of the cut-off value for the dose exclusion is critical for the performance of the PoP
         design, because it ensure the safety of the patients and efficiency of the design by influencing
         the early termination rule. The exclusion boundaries in the table above were determined using
         \eqn{E(n_j)=exp(-1)}.
